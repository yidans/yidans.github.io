I am currently pursuing a PhD in Industrial and Systems Engineering at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, as part of the Artificial Intelligence and Complex Systems ([AICS](https://aicomplex.github.io/)) group, under the guidance of Dr. Mayank Kejriwal. My research interests focus on the intersection of complex systems, network science, and computational social science.
