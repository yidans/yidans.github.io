Hi! My name is Yidan Sun, and I am currently a second-year PhD student in Industrial and Systems Engineering at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering. I am a member of the Artificial Intelligence and Complex Systems ([AICS](https://aicomplex.github.io/)) group at USC Information Sciences Institute, led by Dr. [Mayank Kejriwal](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kejriwal/Mayank). My research focuses on the intersection of complex systems, network science, and computational social science.

Feel free to reach out to me at yidans@usc.edu / yidans@isi.edu
