I am currently pursuing a PhD in Industrial and Systems Engineering at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, as part of the Artificial Intelligence and Complex Systems ([AICS](https://aicomplex.github.io/)) group, under the guidance of Dr. [Mayank Kejriwal](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kejriwal/Mayank). My research interests focus on the intersection of complex systems, network science, and computational social science.
